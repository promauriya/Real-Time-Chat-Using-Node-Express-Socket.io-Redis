# Socket.IO Chat Application with Redis Adapter

This project is a simple chat application that uses Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between clients and servers. The application features two chat servers that utilize Redis as a shared adapter to synchronize messages across multiple instances. This setup allows the servers to scale horizontally and handle messages from any connected client.

## Features

- Real-time messaging with Socket.IO
- Multiple server instances using Redis for message synchronization
- Basic user interface for chat functionality
- CORS support for cross-origin communication
- Simple Express.js server setup for serving HTML pages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Redis server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up a Redis server if not already available. Update the Redis connection string in `server1.js` and `server2.js` files if necessary.

### Running the Application

To start the chat servers:

- Start `server1`:

  ```bash
  npm run start1
  ```

- Start `server2`:

  ```bash
  npm run start2
  ```

Each server will listen on its respective port:

- `server1` on port 3001
- `server2` on port 3002

### Accessing the Chat Application

Open the following URLs in your browser:

- [Server 1](http://localhost:3001) - `index1.html`
- [Server 2](http://localhost:3002) - `index2.html`

### How It Works

1. The client-side code in `index1.html` and `index2.html` connects to the respective server via Socket.IO.
2. Each chat server (defined in `server1.js` and `server2.js`) listens for `chatmessage` events from clients.
3. When a message is received, the server broadcasts it to all connected clients, allowing real-time communication across both server instances.
4. Redis is used as a pub/sub adapter to ensure that messages are synchronized across servers, even if they are hosted on different nodes.

## Project Structure

- `index1.html`, `index2.html` - HTML pages that serve as the front-end for the chat application.
- `server1.js`, `server2.js` - Node.js servers that handle chat messaging and synchronization using Socket.IO and Redis.
- `package.json` - Contains the dependencies and scripts to run the servers.

## Dependencies

- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) - Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - An in-memory data structure store used as the pub/sub adapter.
- [@socket.io/redis-adapter](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis) - Redis adapter for Socket.IO.
